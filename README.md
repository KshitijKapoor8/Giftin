### What our website does

Welcome to Giftin', a novel new platform in which users can view exactly what other users want and manage their own wishlists.

After signing up, all the user has to do is click the plus icon on the wishlist tab and add a new amazon link; the program will automatically get the price and title of the producct from the link, and it will store that information per user. 

The user can also search for the wishlists of other users on the search tab. When the user finds another user and clicks on his name, a modal will open up that will show the wishlist of the other user. Here, the user can buy the products, which will redirect to the amazon link, as well as remove that particular item from the wishlist of the other user.


### To run this program, make sure you have nodejs installed, as well as have cloned the github repository at https://github.com/KshitijKapoor8/Giftin

npm install

npm install nodemon

In case there are errors with the clone, make sure all of the above commands are run.

Afterwards, cd into the backend folder, and in the terminal, run "nodemon server". Note, this may not always work in the very first try, just save the file again and it should start the server fine.

Then, open a new terminal, this time cd into the root project, and run "npm start".

A site should be running on localhost:3000, you should be able to use the entirety of the application.
